🚀 Netflix Data Cleaning & Visualization: A Deep Dive! 🎬📊
Netflix has revolutionized the streaming industry, but have you ever explored the data behind its vast catalog? I took on a data cleaning and visualization challenge to analyze Netflix content trends from 1925 to 2021 using Python and Power BI.

📂 Dataset Overview:
This dataset contains movies and TV shows added to Netflix between 2008 and 2021. The oldest content dates back to 1925, offering a unique opportunity to analyze how Netflix has evolved over time.

🔍 Data Cleaning Process (Using Python – Pandas, NumPy):
✅ Handled missing values by filling or dropping nulls strategically.
✅ Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
✅ Extracted date components (Year, Month, Day) for better trend analysis.
✅ Transformed categorical columns for improved insights.
✅ Created a new 'Genre' column by splitting multi-category data.
✅ Dropped irrelevant columns to optimize the dataset for visualization.

📊 Data Visualization with Power BI:
After cleaning the data, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover key insights:
🎞️ Content Growth: A sharp rise in content additions post-2015.
🌍 Top Countries Producing Netflix Content: The US, India, and the UK lead the charts.
🎬 Popular Genres: Drama and Comedy dominate the platform.
